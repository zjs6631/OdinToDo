# OdinToDo
ToDo list webpage using HTML/CSS/JS/webpack
--This is a to do list app created using HTML CSS JS and webpack to bundle my JS files. 

--Allows for the addition of Projects, which are created using a Project class
--Project object used to create a project div which allows for the addition of tasks
--tasks are created using Todo class. task objects are used to create a task div to display
--task div gives option to display task info and completion status to the user

The main problem faced and solved during the creation of this app was the placement of event listeners and how to target specific buttons and the task information the button should be linked to.

2. Better color scheme
3. navbar height
4. info card text formatting
